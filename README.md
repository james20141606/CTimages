This is a project work in pattern recognition course.
Professor Xuegong Zhang instruct us to study and learn how to analyze 3D CT images. Through this project I have learned multiple image processing tools including opencv, ndimage and scikit-image. 

## Models
- We use 2D unet and VGG and machine learning model to segment nodules and classify them. 
- We use a modified DICE loss function for segmentation. 
- We also use 3D convolution to construct a 3D VGG net to classify samples.
